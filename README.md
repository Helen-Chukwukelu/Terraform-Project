# Terraform-Project
TERRAFORM PROJECT: Create an Ec2 instance, deploy on a custom vpc and custom subnet and assign a public address.  This should be deployed in such a way that you won't only SSH into the server and make changes to it, but as well automatically set a web server to run on it in order to handle web traffic.
